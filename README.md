# Titanic Data Preprocessing ðŸš¢

This project involves cleaning and preprocessing the Titanic dataset for machine learning. Steps include:

### ðŸ§¹ Preprocessing Steps
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Filled missing values (median for Age, mode for Embarked)
- Dropped the Cabin column due to too many nulls
- Encoded categorical columns (Sex and Embarked)
- Normalized Age and Fare using StandardScaler
- Removed outliers using the IQR method
